== Spring HATEOAS CI

Spring HATEOAS uses Concourse as it's CI tool of choice. This provides support for:

* Pipeline against the `master` branch
* Support for pull requests

=== Creating a pipeline

Using the `fly` command, you can execute a series of commands to create multiple pipelines to manage everything. But
first, some critical credentials are needed.

Create a `credentials.yml` file like this:

[source,yml]
----
github-access-token: <your Personal Access Token from github>
docker-email: <your docker hub email address>
docker-username: <your docker hub username>
docker-password: <your docker hub password>
artifactory-username: <your artifactory username>
artifactory-password: <your artifactory encoded password>
----

WARNING: Do NOT check this file into source control! If you'll check, `credentials.yml` is listed in `.gitignore` to prevent this.

With this in place, run the following `fly` commands to create pipelines:

----
% fly -t spring-data sp -p spring-hateoas -c ci/pipeline-template.yml -l credentials.yml -v branch=master
----

With this pipeline in place, you can now activate and expose it:

----
% fly -t spring-data unpause-pipeline -p spring-hateoas
% fly -t spring-data expose-pipeline -p spring-hateoas
----
